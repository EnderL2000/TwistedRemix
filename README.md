# TwistedRemix
### Welcome!
Twisted Remix is a tactical, card based came first created as the final project for an AP Java course. 
It was originally made in a group of four, but the remake is being morked on by me alone.
Feel free to Pull Request if you would like to bug fix/fix my shitty code.
The server/client system is done with Kryo Net.
I will edit this more at a later date, I need sleep now.
